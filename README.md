# Automated-Speech-Recognition-ASR-using-Deep-Learning
In this project we designed and implemented an automated speech recognition (ASR ) system using deep learning methods. We also analyzed the effect of adding layers and number of filters per layer to the model . Effect of implementing a bagging scheme to regularise the network was also tested. A hyper parameter search was also performed using Bayesian optimization .
